# Self Driving Car

## This repo represents my attempt to create a simple Reinforcement Learning algorithm that will learn how to drive a car, using "LEFT", "RIGHT" and "FORWARD" as inputs.

I created everything from scratch, from the game to the RL agent, following the YouTube tutorial/video. It's been a fun project to get started with RL.
